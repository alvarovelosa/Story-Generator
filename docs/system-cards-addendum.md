# System Cards Addendum
## Undeletable Starter Cards (Game Cards)

**Purpose**: Built-in, read-only starter library providing minimal, broad-description cards for immediate scene setup. All cards are Common rarity, Knowledge Level 1, Possession false, source=system. Clone to customize.

**User Benefit**: Zero-setup prototyping. No blank-slate fatigue.

**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- Locked UI (no delete/edit, Clone only)
- Auto-load on init
- Selectable in Player UI with "System" badge
- Descriptions light/broad for LLM flexibility
